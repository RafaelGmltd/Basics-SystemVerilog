# Mealy machine

In this case the graph represents a Mealy machine because its outputs are associated
with the state transitions (edges). The nomenclature 00/0 is quite usual and means that, when
the inputs are 00 (the two bits before the “/”) the output is 0 (the bit after the “/”). So, this
graph shows the behavior of a 2-input, 1-output sequential system
